    <h1>How to Prepare for Your Window Installation</h1>
    <ul class="preparation-list">
      <li>
        <p>
          Installation requires the use of power tools and therefore can be
          loud. Please be prepared for potential noise.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          There will be some amount of dust entering the home, whether it be
          from natural sources or cutting of materials. Our installers will use
          drop cloths and sheet plastic to cover their immediate work area. If
          you have ite ms or furniture outside of the immediate work area that
          you would not want to get dusty, please cover with plastic or similar
          protective material prior the work commencing in that area.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em
            >"Immediate work area" can be defined as an area of approximately 2
            arms lengths from the window or door being installed.</em
          >
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Move furniture or anything blocking access to the windows away from
          the window leaving 2’-3’ of space for workers. Items in front of, but
          not blocking the window do not need to be moved. An example would be a
          dresser that sits below the sill height of the window is not blocking
          access, and therefore would not need to be moved. A bookshelf that is
          in front of the window and is tall enough that it blocks physical
          access would need to be moved. In short, we need to be able to get
          hands on the window on all four sides.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Please remove any blinds or curtains from the window openings where
          new windows are being installed. Note that your existing blinds may
          not fit back as they did before.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Remove any pictures, shelves, or other items hanging or affixed to the
          wall near windows being replaced. There may be hammering that could
          shake the wall and knock the aforementioned items off the wall.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Prepare or arrange an area to store the windows during the
          installation. The are size will vary by job. Larger job = larger area
          needed. The delivery truck will arrive the morning of the first
          installation day with all the windows/doors. The drivers and crew will
          need an area to offload the items to, and store for the duration of
          the job. Note that the windows will be stacked against a wall
          vertically.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Final payment will be collected by the lead installer once the job is
          completed and the final walk through performed. The lead will give you
          a packet containing a current invoice, original contract docs,
          applicable change orders, and manufacturer's warranties and additional
          information. Note if any items need to be reordered or
          warranty/replacement parts are needed, it is customary to withhold
          $500 per window/door from the final balance.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Please be prepared to pay the balance of the job on the day of
          installation. We accept cash, check, and all major credit cards.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          during the installation don’t hesitate to contact our office @ (808)
